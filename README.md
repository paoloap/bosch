Awesome WM 'Bosch Theme'

In this git I will upload all the configuration files that make my GUI work properly.
This GUI configuration is intended to be as much as lightweight I can, and to maximize keyboard/automation and minimize mouse/touchpad use.

I adopt the following:
- Arch
- 'awesome' window manager (with some libraries, including 'vicious' and 'lain-git'. See awesome/rc.lua for more details
- 'oomox-early_bird' gtk3 theme -> https://github.com/actionless/oomox
- 'area o.43' gtk icon theme -> http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/area.o43+SVG+Icon+theme?content=101979
- 'termite' terminal emulator
- 'vimb' web browser
- 'mpd' music server
- 'ncmpcpp' mpd client
- 'pcmanfm' xorg file manager
- 'turses' ncurses twitter client
- 'rtv' ncurses reddit client
- 'toxic' ncurses tox chat client
- 'vlc' video player
- 'hangups' ncurses chat hangout client
- 'transmission-remote-cli' ncurses torrent client
- 'acpi' for notebook power saving purposes
- 'pulseaudio' audio server
- 'pulsemixer' ncurses pulseaudio volume control manager
- 'sxiv' as pics viewer
- 'zsh' as shell
- 'vim' (of course!) as text editor
- 'lightdm' as session manager (and lockscreen)
- 'taskwarrior' / 'timewarrior' to manage my tasks
- ...some other stuff that I don't remember now :) and various little scripts to automatize
