Awesome WM 'Bosch Theme'
v 0.6

In this git I will upload all the configuration files that make my GUI work properly.
This GUI configuration is intended to be as much as lightweight I can, and to maximize keyboard/automation and minimize mouse/touchpad use.

While I improved a lot the code and decoupled many things, I still discourage to try to make this work out of the box. It's not perfect in my own pc, probably in other ones just few things will work. If you like it, for now just take inspiration and copy-paste the code parts you're interested in :)

NEW STUFF:

0.6
- now the theme in compatible (only?) with awesome git version
- decoupled almost everything
- created a config.lua file
- changed colors and various settings
- added gtk theme (generated with oomox)
- added icon theme (areao43, edited)
- other things that i don't remember...


0.5
- added config part in theme.lua
- rewrited and decoupled all bwibox
- rewrited and decoupled all tiling part (layouts and tags management)

0.4
- added a color palette
- added ncmpcpp and termite config files
- the awesome files now are compatible (only?) with awesome git/dev version
- started decoupling some functions
- added gap for maximized windows
- added a "switcher" to view all non-minimezed windows in a maximized layout (see below)
- fixed notifications
- fixed minimized clients wibox
- some corrections here and there

TODO:
